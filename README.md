# Overview

This is a project that I have written to familiarize myself with C++. I have never written in C++ before, so this project was a fun option that I could work on to learn more about the language!

# Development Environment

To build this program, I used XCode. No special libraries were used. 

# Useful Websites

As I was working on this project, I found W3Schools helpful while trying to familiarize myself with the language:

# Future Work

Moving forward, I want to allow each player to log in and play multiple games. I also want it to keep track of how many puzzles they have solved. 
I am also going to add features so that they can take back a turn and a completed function that will test if their answer is correct, not just
if it works in the current position.
